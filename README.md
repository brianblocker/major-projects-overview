## Summary
Over 4 1/2 years at _a major financial institution_, I led two major AI/ML initiatives:
1. [Model Explainability Tool](/model-explainability.html) - a web-based application that allowed model developers a better way to keep track their experimentation runs and results during the model development phase. On this project I was the UI tech lead.
2. [Machine Learning Platform](/machine-learning-platform.html) - a enterprise platform with web, CLI, API, & SDK interfaces that sped up the process of getting a model to production by providing compliant tooling for model experimentation, training, serving, monitoring, and re-fitting. On this project I was the Senior Manager of the UI team, and eventually acting director over the developer experience group.

Throughout my tenure I played a critical role in architectural decisions, performance management, project management, program management, customer engagement, incident management, as well as varying levels of individual contribution when necessary.
